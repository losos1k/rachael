            <h3>Who we are, what we believe:</h3>
            <p>
                I started working as a photographer a few years ago and fell in love!
            </p>
            <p>
                Rachael Watson Photography Inc. was something I didn't even dream of
                starting. A graduate of Judson University with knowledge in my head
                and shoes on my feet, I knew a lot, but didn't know where I was going.
                What I did know what that there was something out there waiting for me.
                I finally decided to take the plunge. Photography has been a part of my
                life as long as I can remember. Growing up I took countless rolls of film
                and finally, my first digital camera! Reflecting on these things I
                remembered what my mentor told me all those years ago...passion + gifts =
                calling, so I took the things I knew and loved, then took a leap of faith.
            </p>
            <p>
                Photography is something I love because of the people I get to meet and the
                memories I get to capture for them, the love, joy and excitement of new beginnings.
            </p>
            <h4>Our Values:</h4>
            <p>
                Rachael Watson Photography Inc. has three core values I have built my company
                on, Quality Work, Great Service and <a href="#give">Giving Back</a>. I work my hardest so you end
                up with the best quality images, images you will be excited to share with your
                friends and loved ones.
            </p>
            <a name="give"></a>
            <h4>Giving Back:</h4>
            <p>
                What I'm most proud of though, is our commitment to giving back to the local community.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use Rachael Watson Photography Inc., you give back to the community
                around you. From the start Rachael Watson Photography Inc. is committed to
                giving back 10% of sales to local organizations working with youth. Here are
                two of the organizations Rachael Watson Photography Inc. gives to.
            </p>
            <h4>Outreach Community Ministries -Carol Stream, IL</h4>
            <p>
                Mission Statement: "To restore hope and provide
                opportunities for people to become all that God intends them to be;
                partnered with the local church to put Christian faith into action
                through service to the community."
            </p>
            <h4>Triple Threat Mentoring -Aurora, IL</h4>
            <p>
                Mission Statement: "To empower urban youth to realize
                their potential and inspire volunteers to leave a lasting legacy. We're not
                just a youth organization. We're an organization that facilitates relationships
                between youth and volunteers through our passion-based programs."
            </p>
            <h4>Looking to the Future</h4>
            <p>My hope is that as Rachael Watson Photography expands, so can our impact in
                local communities. My hope is that in the future we can give not only to
                these and other local organizations, but also that Rachael Watson Photography
                Inc. would be able to personally come alongside adolescents and holistically
                mentor the next generation too.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to be part of investing in the future. If you know of an organizations
                whose primary focus is working with, investing in and doing life with youth,
                pass their information along to us! We would love to learn more about them and
                maybe they can become one of the organizations we donate to.
            </p>
